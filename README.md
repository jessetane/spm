# spm

## What
Deploy and command multiple versions of multiple services on multiple hosts in multiple environments.



## Why
spm is a tool for deploying and supervising services. 

npm isn't a great tool for snapshotting updates
npm can't push
npm naming is lame, urls are better imo

## How
Not sure yet.



## Usage
Not stable... still experimenting.
