# deployer
Deploy and command multiple versions of multiple services on multiple hosts in multiple environments.

## Why
The world needs more deploy tools, duh.

## How
Not sure yet.

## Usage
Not stable... still experimenting.

## License
MIT

## TODO
* need a way to support multiple names/service (www)
* should export variables before running commands
* operator proxy needs to hide errors
* operator needs a better 404
* withdraw error only happens when > 1 version is deployed
* need a way to pass env variables
* stream ssh command output?

# no way to run user scripts at boot | this could be solved by having one system job loop over the users' .init folder
